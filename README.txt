Usually to start the game, you'd go double click on `index.html` to
open the local webpage in your browser, and further instructions
to interact with the "game" would be given.

However, due to overambition, and multiple complexities of the game,
 ones that plague the game-development world, I was unable to get the
 actual game portion done (tracing a circle and all that jazz) done.

However (x2), there are two demos present in the `src` folder that I used for testing.
You can use the W, A, S, and D keys to move this player/cursor around and press enter (in `demo_menus.html`)
to interact with the buttons.

Sorry the demos are disappointing, and not having the game adds on to that. D:
Hopefully what I have shows I'm to some degree competent.

But hey, I'll take a bet and guess you're pretty great at drawing circles! :D
